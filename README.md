# CorrelatedInformationOptimization
This work develops a PSO-VLP-based multi-UAV scheduler to minimize long-term AoCI by leveraging data correlation and optimized drone paths, and, through extensive simulations and benchmarking against ACO and GA, demonstrates reduced AoI and higher computational efficiency as UAV count increases, with full implementation provided.
